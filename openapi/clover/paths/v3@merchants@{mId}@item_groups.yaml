  summary: Get all item groups
  description: >-
    Item groups allow merchants to create and manage large groups of related
    items. This is described to merchants as an 'Item with variants'.


    For example, a merchant may sell a T-shirt that is available in various
    sizes and colors. Each of the T-shirt variations is an item and belongs to
    the T-shirt item group. Once an item group is created, it appears in
    Register as a single button, and tapping it brings up a choice of which
    variation is to be sold.


    Before adding items to an item group, you first need to create the item
    group. Next, you create attributes (such as 'size' and 'color') and options
    for each attribute (such as 'small' and 'blue'). Then, you create the
    individual items and include the item group id to associate the items with
    the group. Finally, associate the options with an item.


    An item can only belong to an item group if the item group id is specified
    when the item is created.


    The name of an item which is a member of an item group is automatically
    generated by the Clover server as a combination of the item group name and
    the name of all the options associated with that item. It cannot be changed.
    If the item group name is changed, or if an option name is changed, then the
    item names will be automatically regenerated.


    An item can only be a member of a single item group and once it is part of
    an item group it can never be removed or moved to another item group; it can
    only be deleted.
