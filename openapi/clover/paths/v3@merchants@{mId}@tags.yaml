    Similarly to how they are described by wikipedia, tags are an informal way
    of establishing a relationship. Tags currently may be associated with items
    and printers. When an tag is associated with both an item and a printer that
    establishes a special relationship that results in those items being printed
    out on the associated printer when printing an order. Other than that
    special case there is no effect when an item is associated with a tag.
    Developers may use tags to establish a relationship meaningful for their
    needs.
