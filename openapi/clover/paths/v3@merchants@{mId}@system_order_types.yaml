  summary: Return a list of system order types
  description: >-
    Merchants can create custom Order Types via
    "/v3/merchants/{mId}/order_types". It is useful to associate these custom
    order types with particular system order types in order to group things
    functionally. For example, a merchant may have a "Lunch Take-Out" order type
    and a "Dinner Take-Out" order type. These two order types can be associated
    with the "TAKE-OUT-TYPE" system order type so that applications can
    understand that they are both take-out order types.
